# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.) 

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username enumeration - When it is a valid username, the error is bold. If user does not exist, the error is not bold. See attached "Challenge Goal 1 Again.gif" file.

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference - When logged out, I can view a Salesperson that is not public yet by changing the Salesperson ID to the not public ID (10) and see that salepersons information. See attached "Challenge Goal 2.gif" file.

Vulnerability #2: __________________
